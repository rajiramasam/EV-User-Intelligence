## Usage Examples

### Basic Chat
```
User: "How do I find charging stations near me?"
Bot: "I can help you find charging stations! There are several ways to locate them:
- Use apps like PlugShare, ChargePoint, or Tesla's app
- Check your vehicle's built-in navigation
- Visit websites like OpenChargeMap.org
- Use Google Maps and search for 'EV charging stations'

What's your general location? I can provide more specific guidance."
```

### Quick Reply Interaction
```
Bot: "What would you like to know about electric vehicles?"
[Quick Reply Buttons: "Find charging stations", "Get recommendations", "EV tips"]

User clicks: "Find charging stations"
Bot: "Great! I can help you find charging stations. What's your current location or where are you planning to charge? üìç"
```

### Technical Support
```
User: "My EV won't charge, what should I do?"
Bot: "I'm sorry to hear you're having charging issues. Let's troubleshoot this step by step:

1. Check the basics:
   - Is your charging cable properly connected?
   - Are there any error lights on your vehicle or charger?
   - Is your vehicle's charging port clean and undamaged?

2. Try these steps:
   - Unplug and reconnect the charging cable
   - Try a different charging station if available
   - Check your vehicle's charging settings

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: If you see any warning lights or smell anything unusual, stop immediately and contact a qualified EV technician or your vehicle manufacturer.

What specific symptoms are you experiencing?"
